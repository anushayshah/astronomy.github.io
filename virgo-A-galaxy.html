            <p>The Virgo Cluster is a large cluster of galaxies whose center is 53.8 ± 0.3 Mly (16.5 ± 0.1 Mpc)[2] away in the constellation Virgo. Comprising approximately 1,300 (and possibly up to 2,000) member galaxies.

            The Virgo Cluster is a large cluster of galaxies whose center is 53.8 ± 0.3 Mly (16.5 ± 0.1 Mpc)[2] away in the constellation Virgo. Comprising approximately 1,300 (and possibly up to 2,000) member galaxies,[3] the cluster forms the heart of the larger Virgo Supercluster, of which the Local Group (containing our Milky Way galaxy) is a member. The Local Group actually experiences the mass of the Virgo Supercluster as the Virgocentric flow. It is estimated that the Virgo Cluster's mass is 1.2×1015 M☉ out to 8 degrees of the cluster's center or a radius of about 2.2 Mpc.Many of the brighter galaxies in this cluster, including the giant elliptical galaxy Messier 87, were discovered in the late 1770s and early 1780s and subsequently included in Charles Messier's catalogue of non-cometary fuzzy objects. Described by Messier as nebulae without stars, their true nature was not recognized until the 1920s.The cluster subtends a maximum arc of approximately 8 degrees centered in the constellation Virgo. Although some of the cluster's most prominent members can be seen with smaller instruments, a 6-inch telescope will reveal about 160 of the cluster's galaxies on a clear night. Its brightest member is the elliptical galaxy Messier 49; however its most famous member is the elliptical galaxy Messier 87, which is located in the center of the cluster.

        <h1>All about the Virgo:</h1>
        <p>Our home galaxy, the Milky Way, along with a few dozen of its neighbors, belongs to a group of galaxies, just a small knot in a larger cosmic network. To understand how our local environs fit into the cosmos at the largest scales, definitions are surprisingly important.Many of those definitions involve gravity, which works on a variety of scales. A star is a gravitationally bound clump of hot ionized gas, where nuclear fusion at the core generates energy. A galaxy is a gravitationally bound system of gas, dust, and millions or billions of stars. A galaxy group comes next, and it usually holds a few dozen members. A galaxy cluster with hundreds or thousands of galaxies is a larger gravitationally bound object, where the mutual attraction is strong enough that even cosmic expansion won’t pull the pieces apart.</p>

        The Virgo Cluster is the closest large cluster of galaxies to the Milky Way. With over a thousand known members, the cluster spans an area of the sky about 5 by 3 degrees in size. While some of the most prominent members can be seen in smaller instruments, a 6-inch telescope will reveal about 160 galaxies in this region on a clear night.The Virgo Cluster contains about 2,000 galaxies. </p>

        In the 1950s, French astronomer Gérard de Vaucouleurs observed how these Virgo galaxies traveled through space. Curiously, they seemed to be moving away from us at the same speed and lay fairly close to one another and to us. They were, in astronomy parlance, “dynamically related.” In 1953, he christened this crowd the Local Supergalaxy. Five years later, he changed it to the Local Supercluster. </p>

        <h1 class="work2">Constellation Virgo A:</h1>
              <p class="work1">
                The constellation Virgo stretches across the celestial equator and is visible in many places. It appears between 67° N and 76° S, which means it is not visible north of the Arctic Circle and in areas of the Antarctic. The months of March to May offer the best view of the constellation.
                
                Virgo lies on the ecliptic, so the sun passes through the constellation every year between September 16th and October 31st. During this time, the constellation cannot be seen as it rises and sets with the sun on the horizon.
