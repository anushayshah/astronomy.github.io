            <h1>Magellanic Clouds</h1>
            <p>The Magellanic Clouds are irregular galaxies that share a gaseous envelope and lie about 22° apart in the sky near the south celestial pole.

            The Magellanic Clouds were formed at about the same time as the Milky Way Galaxy, approximately 13 billion years ago. They are presently captured in orbits around the Milky Way Galaxy and have experienced several tidal encounters with each other and with the Galaxy. They contain numerous young stars and star clusters, as well as some much older stars. One of these star clusters contains R136a1, the most massive star known, with a mass 265 times that of the Sun.

        <h1>The Magellanic Clouds:</h1>
        <p>Besides being spectacular nighttime objects, the Magellanic Clouds are popular targets for professional astronomers. In fact, they’ve been featured in more than 15,000 research papers, a total to which my thesis added two. There are many reasons for their popularity, including their proximity. They are as nearby as galaxies get, roughly 160,000 light-years for the LMC and some 200,000 light-years for the SMC. This means they are close enough to be studied in detail, yet far enough away that their stars can be approximated as being at uniform distances — unlike those of the Milky Way, where it can be difficult to see the forest for the trees. </p>

        The LMC is the third closest galaxy to the Milky Way, at 160,000 light-years away. And at around 210,000 light-years from Earth, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the furthest object us southerners can see with the naked eye during the winter months.
        Without visual aids the Magellanic Clouds look like roughly rectangular patches of light, but with decent binoculars or a small telescope you can see nebulae strewn through the LMC. The most outstanding of these is the Tarantula Nebula – the most active star-forming region in the 30-odd galaxies including the Milky Way.

        <p>
            The SMC circles around the South Celestial Pole almost opposite the Southern Cross (Crux), so you can use Crux to find it. 
            Just follow the long line of Crux from the brightest star at the foot (α Crucis) for about six lengths of the cross – you’ll see the SMC as a patch of light nearby if you’re in a dark enough area. Once you’ve found the SMC, look about one hand-span towards Crux, and you should see a larger bar-shaped patch of light – the LMC.  
            Because they’re so close to the South Celestial Pole, the Magellanic Clouds can only be seen from the southern hemisphere. </p>

              <p class="work1">The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), or Nubecula Minor, is a dwarf galaxy near the Milky Way.[5] Classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy, the SMC has a D25 isophotal diameter of about 5.78 kiloparsecs (18,900 light-years),[1][3] and contains several hundred million stars.[5] It has a total mass of approximately 7 billion solar masses.[6] At a distance of about 200,000 light-years, the SMC is among the nearest intergalactic neighbors of the Milky Way and is one of the most distant objects visible to the naked eye.  </p>
