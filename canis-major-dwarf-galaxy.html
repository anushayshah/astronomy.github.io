            <h1>Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy</h1>
            <p>The closest known galaxy to us is the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, at 236,000,000,000,000,000 km (25,000 light years) from the Sun. The Sagittarius Dwarf Elliptical Galaxy is the next closest , at 662,000,000,000,000,000 km (70,000 light years) from the Sun.

        <h1>Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy Location:</h1>
        <p>Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy's location is 07h 12m 35.0 (R.A.) and -27d 40' 0 (Dec.). They are celestial equivalents of Longitude and Latitude. The right ascension (longitude) is the angular distance of an object along the celestial equator from the March Equinox. As a rough guide, the March Equinox is located in the constellation of Pisces. If the number is negative, it is "west" of the March Equinox.
            The declination (latitude) is the dwarf galaxy's angle from the celestial equator. A negative value indicates it is in the southern hemisphere.
            
            Based on the location of Canis Major, Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy can be located in the southern hemisphere of the celestial sky. The celestial hemisphere is equivalent to the hemispheres on Earth. Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy is south of the Ecliptic. The Ecliptic is the path the Earth takes as it orbits the Sun. As the Earth is titled, we have Celestial and Ecliptic hemispheres.</p>

        <h1>What is Dwarf galaxy?</h1>
        <p>Dwarf galaxies are appropriately named. Regular galaxies can be hundreds of light-years in diameter, but dwarf galaxies are typically just a fraction of the size. For example, our own Milky Way is a pretty average-sized galaxy; it’s about 100,000 light-years across and is thought to contain more than 100 billion stars.

            The largest known galaxy, IC 1101, is roughly four million light-years across and is thought to contain 100 trillion stars. At the other end of the scale, dwarf galaxies are usually only a few thousand light-years in diameter and contain millions of stars. However, what they lack in size they make up in numbers, as they’re often the satellite galaxies of their larger cousins. As such, there are far more dwarf galaxies than regular galaxies in the cosmos.</p>

      <p>Hundreds of millions of years ago, the Canis Majoris Dwarf Galaxy was likely considerably larger than it is today, and some astronomers figure that it may have contributed as much as 1% of the Milky Way’s current stellar material. As our galaxy devours the Canis Majoris Dwarf through of gravity, eventually all of its stars will be integrated into the Milky Way, becoming all but indistinguishable from the primary mass.</p>

        <p>The team of astronomers that discovered it were collaborating on analysis of data from the Two-Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS), a comprehensive survey of the sky in infrared light, which is not blocked by gas and dust as severely as visible light. Because of this technique, scientists were able to detect a very significant over-density of class M giant stars in a part of the sky occupied by the Canis Major Constellation.

        <h1 class="work2">Constellation:</h1>
              <p class="work1">Canis Major, (Latin: “Greater Dog”) constellation in the southern sky, at about 7 hours right ascension and 20° south in declination. The brightest star in Canis Major is Sirius, the brightest star in the sky and the fifth nearest to Earth, at a distance of 8.6 light-years. This constellation is also home to the Canis Major Dwarf Galaxy, which at a distance of 25,000 light-years is the closest galaxy to Earth. Because of its proximity to Orion, the constellation was identified as one of Orion’s hunting dogs. Canis Major was also thought to represent other dogs in Greek mythology, such as one of the hounds of Actaeon.</p>
